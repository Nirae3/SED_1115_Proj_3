## GB: Initial Detailed Design
### Deadline: Nov 12: 12:30 PM
Update your design to include another level of detail (i.e. the “calling structure”) which includes the function calls in your code, but not the detailed code, itself, for those functions. This ‘skeletal’ code will define all of your functions and will show all data inputs and all returned values. You need to document how each function will be called. To do this, you will have to decide what data structures you will be creating and updating and where exactly these changes will happen (i.e. in which specific function).


## GC: Initial Code Demonstration and Github Issue Status
### Deadline: Nov 17: 11:59 PM

Demonstrate that your code design and testing work is on track, by submitting your code into Github and providing a link (complete with indications if any code has been re-used from elsewhere). The focus of this deliverable is on demonstrating progress and showing that you are “on track” with your design and testing, which you will do by listing your github issues along with their resolutions, if any (hint: raise github issues for all missing or errored functionality).


## GD: Final Code Demonstration and Github Issue Status
### Deadline: Dec 2: 11:59 PM

Demonstrate that your code design and testing work is complete with a functional demonstration of your project, showing all features. Review the status of all github issues and identify all outstanding or unresolved issues as well as specifying the contributions of all team members.
